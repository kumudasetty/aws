Allocating Elastic IP addresses
Elastic IP (EIP) address is the static public IP address. 
You can attach and detach the EIP from EC2 instance at any time. Instances in EC2-Classic support only one private IP address and corresponding EIP. 
Instances in EC2-VPC support multiple private IP addresses, and each one can have a corresponding EIP. 
If you stop the instance in EC2-Classic the EIP is disassociated from instance, and you have to associate it again when you start the instance.
But if you stop the instance in EC2-VPC, the EIP remains associated with the EC2 instance.

$ aws ec2 allocate-address
--domain [Domain]

The parameters used in this command are described here:
[Domain] : Domain value indicates whether the EIP address is used with instances in EC2-Classic (standard) or instances in a EC2-VPC (VPC).
You have to specify whether domain is standard or VPC. Record the allocation ID for further use.

create the Elastic IP in VPC
$ aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc

to associate the Elastic IP to the Elastic Network Interface (ENI):
$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id [NetworkInterfaceId]
--allocation-id [AllocationId]
