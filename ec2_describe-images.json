Before we launch the EC2 instances, we need the image ID.
Run the following command to get the list of images. 
We can apply the fiter to identify a specific image. Record the image ID for later use:

$ aws ec2 describe-images
--filter [Filter]

By executing the following command, you obtain the image ID of a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 image:
$ aws ec2 describe-images
--filter
"Name=virtualization-type,Values=paravirtual"
"Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs" "Name=architecture,Values=x86_64"
"Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/ebs/ubuntu-precise-12.04-amd64-
server-20130204"
