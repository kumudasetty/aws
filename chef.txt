Identify the resources required
• Create a cookbook
• Write a recipe
• cookbooks/resolv/default.rb
• cookbooks/resolv/files/default/resolv.conf
• Update the run list
• Converge the node

Nodes: Servers, VMs or physical machines or cloud instances.
Cookbook: A cookbook is a collection of recipes, attributes, and templates that Chef uses to package, distribute, and share configuration details. A chef repository can have many cookbooks and typically a cookbook configures only one service.
Roles: Roles are a way to group nodes by the function. Each role is associated with a run_list i.e. a set of cookbook/recipies that need to execute in given sequence for configuring the node. Nodes can have multiple roles.
Environments: In chef different nodes could belong to different environments like dev, stage, prod, etc. Like roles environments also have a run_list.
Data Bags: Data bags are like cookbook attributes but are used to store sensitive information like passwords, api keys, secrets, etc.
