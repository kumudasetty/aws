Attaching the network interface to an instance
By running the following command, we can attach the ENI to an EC2 instance. You will need to provide the ENI ID, EC2 instance ID, and the device index.
$ aws ec2 attach-network-interface
--network-interface-id [NetworkInterfaceId]
--instance-id [InstanceId]
--device-index [DeviceIndex]

The parameters used in this command are described as follows:
[NetworkInterfaceId] : This parameter provides the network interface ID to attach to an EC2 instance
[InstanceId] : This one provides an EC2 instance ID
[DeviceIndex] : This parameter provides the index of the device for the network interface attachment

$ aws ec2 attach-network-interface
--network-interface-id eni-5c88f739
--instance-id i-2e7dace3
--device-index 1

Associating the Elastic IP to the ENI
By running the following command, we can associate the EIP to the ENI. You have to provide the ENI ID, EIP allocation ID, and the private address.
$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id [NetworkInterfaceId]
--allocation-id [AllocationId]
--private-ip-address [PrivateIpAddress]

The parameters used in this command are described as follows:
[NetworkInterfaceId] : This parameter provides the network interface ID to attach to an EC2 instance
[AllocationId] : This gives the allocation ID of EIP, which is required for EC2-VPC
[PrivateIpAddress] : If no private IP address is specifid, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address
Next, run the following command to associate the EIP to 10.0.0.26 (the private IP address of the ENI):

$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id eni-5c88f739
--allocation-id eipalloc-d59f80b7
--private-ip-address 10.0.0.26
