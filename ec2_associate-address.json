to create the Elastic IP in VPC
$ aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc

to associate the Elastic IP to the Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id [NetworkInterfaceId]
--allocation-id [AllocationId]

The parameters used in this command are described here:
[NetworkInterfaceId] : This gives the ENI ID to attach
[AllocationId] : This provides the allocation ID of the EIP for EC2-VPC

$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id eni-d68df2b3
--allocation-id eipalloc-82e0ffe0

You need to provide the network interface ID of the ENI and allocation ID of the Elastic IP 
If you don't specify the private IP address, then the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address.

Associating the EIP to the ENI
By running the following command, we can associate the EIP to the ENI. 
You have to provide the ENI ID, EIP allocation ID, and the private address.

$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id [NetworkInterfaceId]
--allocation-id [AllocationId]
--private-ip-address [PrivateIpAddress]

The parameters used in this command are described as follows:
[NetworkInterfaceId] : This parameter provides the network interface ID to attach to an EC2 instance
[AllocationId] : This gives the allocation ID of EIP, which is required for EC2-VPC
[PrivateIpAddress] : If no private IP address is specifid, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address

$ aws ec2 associate-address
--network-interface-id eni-5c88f739
--allocation-id eipalloc-d59f80b7
--private-ip-address 10.0.0.26
